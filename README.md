3. **Open Notebook**: Open the notebook file in Jupyter and run cells sequentially
4. **Customize**: Modify hyperparameters, add algorithms, or adjust visualizations as needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Conda command not found
**Solution**: Ensure Anaconda/Miniconda is properly installed and added to PATH

**Issue**: Environment creation fails
**Solution**:

```bash
conda clean --all
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

**Issue**: Package conflicts
**Solution**:

```bash
conda env remove -n breast_cancer_ml
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

**Issue**: Jupyter kernel not found
**Solution**:

```bash
conda activate breast_cancer_ml
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=breast_cancer_ml --display-name="Breast Cancer ML"
```

**Issue**: Import errors in notebook
**Solution**: Ensure the correct kernel is selected in Jupyter (Kernel → Change Kernel → Breast Cancer ML)

## Environment Management Commands

**List all conda environments:**

```bash
conda env list
```

**Update the environment:**

```bash
conda activate breast_cancer_ml
conda env update -f environment.yml
```

**Remove the environment:**

```bash
conda env remove -n breast_cancer_ml
```

**Install additional packages:**

```bash
conda activate breast_cancer_ml
conda install package_name
# or
pip install package_name
```

## Expected Results

The notebook will provide:

- **Model Accuracy**: >95% classification accuracy
- **Clinical Metrics**: High sensitivity and specificity
